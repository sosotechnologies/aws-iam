## cluster
Key Points:

- Cluster Name (reflect-project):
This should match the cluster name used in your Envoy routing configuration. Ensure the name reflect-project is referenced correctly elsewhere in your configuration (e.g., in routes or listeners).

- Connect Timeout (connect_timeout: 0.25s):
A 250ms timeout is reasonable for a cluster. However, if connections to the service might take longer, you may want to increase this value to avoid unnecessary timeouts.

- Type (type: logical_dns):
The logical_dns type is appropriate if you're using a DNS name for the service (like argowf-argo-workflows-server.argo.svc.cluster.local).

- HTTP/2 Protocol Options (http2_protocol_options: {}):
This indicates that the cluster supports HTTP/2, which is fine as long as the service you're connecting to supports it.

- Load Balancing Policy (lb_policy: round_robin):
round_robin is a standard and efficient load balancing strategy. Since argowf-argo-workflows-server is a ClusterIP service, Kubernetes will handle the distribution of traffic to the backend pods.

- Hosts:
The hosts section specifies the backend to which Envoy will route traffic. Using argowf-argo-workflows-server.argo.svc.cluster.local with the correct port_value (2746) is correct for this service.

### Validation Steps
- DNS Resolution:

```sh
nslookup argowf-argo-workflows-server.argo.svc.cluster.local
curl http://argowf-argo-workflows-server.argo.svc.cluster.local:2746
```
